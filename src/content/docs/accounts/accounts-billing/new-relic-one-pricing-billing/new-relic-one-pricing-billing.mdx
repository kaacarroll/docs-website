An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing.

<Callout variant="important">
  This document explains the New Relic One pricing model. If you’re on our original pricing model, see [Original pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing). Not sure which you're on?

## How the New Relic One pricing model works [#how-pricing-works]

Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing model that we call **New Relic One pricing**. Customers on our original pricing model are able to [transition to this pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-to-transition).

For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors:

* The amount of data [ingested](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks/). 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that.
* The number of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), who have access to our [more curated UI experiences](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-capabilities). [Basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) are free. 
  * The cost of each full user depends on your edition: [Standard, Pro, or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing). Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and [other features](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 

For a summary of what's included for free, see [Free edition](#free).

For an overview of pricing, see our [Pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Billing and usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see [Pricing and billing UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#new-relic-one-pricing).

If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also [run queries of your usage data and set up alerts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/queries-alerts).

## Billing calculation details [#calculation-details]

For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui). Here are some more details about how billing works:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="usage-calculation"
    title="Data usage calculation"
  >
    One [pricing](#how-pricing-works) factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the [usage UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    Other calculation details:

    * In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
    * Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.

    For more on how data is ingested, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

  <Collapser
    id="user-count"
    title="Full user count billing details"
  >
For accounts with [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), the monthly count of provisioned [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. 

A user's [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type) is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: **a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period.** If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see [Tips on assigning user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#decide-user-type).

Here are more user-related billing details and caveats:
  * You can see your full user count [in the UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
  * We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes.
  * The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user.
  * A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.  
  * For organizations on our original user model that have a [parent/child account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see [User count discrepancy](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#full-user-count). 
  * The [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) of the New Relic One pricing model includes one free full user. 
  * For organizations on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#user-type), because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user.

    For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked [in the UI](#billing-usage-ui).

    When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month.

    For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill.

    For how to query user-related usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts).

## Free tier [#free]

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free:

* A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization).
* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type).
