New Relic CodeStream account settings let you make changes to your personal account.

## Account overview [#overview]

The **Account** menu is located under the ellipses menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. The account menu includes options for viewing your profile and changing your profile photo, username, full name, and email address.

When you change your email address, the old one will remain in effect until you click the link in the confirmation email that's sent to you.

If you'd like to cancel your CodeStream account, find that option  under **Other Actions**.

## Account profile [#profile]

If you click a headshot from anywhere in CodeStream (such as, the activity feed or a discussion thread) you're taken to that person's profile page.

When viewing your own profile page, hover over entries for username, email address, phone number, works on, or the profile photo to see a pencil icon that enables you to make changes to those fields.
