<figcaption>The main sidebar sections are: pull requests, feedback requests, codemarks, observability, and issues.</figcaption>

## Sidebar overview [#overview]

Here's a quick overview of the sidebar sections:

* **[Pull requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section)**: If your team uses GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to host your code, you'll see all of your open pull requests listed here. Click a specific pull request to start reviewing or editing it.
* **[Feedback requests](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/feedback-requests-section)**: If you've been assigned a feedback request or you've requested feedback from someone else, find those listed here.
* **[Codemarks](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/codemarks-section)**: Codemarks are the discussions that annotate your codebase. Codemarks are created pull requests, feedback requests, or through ad hoc code comments/issues. All of the codemarks in your current repository are listed for reference.
* **[Observability](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/observability-section)**: Track errors assigned to you in New Relic One and discover recent errors in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
* **[Issues](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/issues-section)**: See all of your open issues, across multiple services, in one place. Click a specific issue to update its status, create a feature branch to do your work, and update your status on Slack.

The CodeStream sidebar is completely customizable: 

* Drag and drop the sections to reorder them. 
* Click and drag a section divider to resize the sections on either side. 
* Expand or collapse each section as needed. 
* Click the maximize button in each section to fill the whole screen. This is useful when you're looking at a longer list. Click it again to return to your previous view.
