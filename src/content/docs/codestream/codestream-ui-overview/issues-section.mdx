New Relic CodeStream issues are where you'll see the issues from your external code-hosting or issue-tracking service.

## Connect your service to CodeStream [#connect]

If you're not already connected to an external service, this section lists all of the available, supported services:

* Asana
* Azure DevOps
* Bitbucket (cloud)
* Clubhouse
* GitHub (cloud or Enterprise)
* GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed)
* Jira (cloud or Server)
* Linear
* Trello
* YouTrack (cloud)

## Manage your issues [#manage-issues]

Once you’ve connected to your team’s issue-tracking or code-hosting services, all of the issues assigned to you are listed in the issues section.

Your organization can use multiple external services at once. Select the one you want to use from the dropdown list.

![Select Providers](/images/Tasks-MultipleProviders.png)

Click an issue to start working on it. You can create a feature branch, update the ticket status, and even update your status on Slack.

![Start Work](/images/IssuesStartWork.png)

Hover over an issue's row to see an option to view the issue on your issue-tracking service toward the end of the row. 

For many services you can also filter the list. For example, if you’re connected to Trello, you can filter to see a specific list or set of lists.

For Jira, Jira Server, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and GitLab Self-managed you can even create custom filters. 

There are some special guidelines when creating a custom query for [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section/#github) or for [GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/pull-requests-section/#gitlab).

Hover over the section's heading for more options.

![Issues Header](/images/IssuesSectionHeader.png)

Click the refresh button to update the list with any recently added tickets.

Click **New issue** (although it may be labelled differently based on the selected service) to create a issue in your issue-tracking service right from CodeStream. You can even associate that ticket with a block of code in your editor.

If you need to work on something that doesn’t have an associated ticket, you can click **Start Ad-hoc Work** to get started without a ticket.
