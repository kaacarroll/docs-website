New Relic CodeStream provides a number of tools for managing your organization.

## The organization menu [#my-organization]

![My Organization Menu](./images/MyOrgMenu.png)

In the header, click the **My Organization** menu button to see who's in your New Relic CodeStream organization, invite new members, and create blame maps. 

Admins are identified in the teammates list. If you're an admin, there's a dropdown to assign or remove admin privileges to any member.

## Invite your teammates [#invite]

Click **Invite Teammates** to invite new members to your organization.

The outstanding invitations section lists all open invitations. The right side of each row has links to remove the invitation or to resend the invite.

Click **reinvite** to send another invitation via email. You can also hover over the reinvite link for the option to generate an email yourself.

The suggested teammates section, only available for admins, is a list of possible teammates derived from the commit history of your open repositories. At the right side of each row are links to remove the suggestion from the list or to invite the person.

## Blame map [#blame]

Click **Blame Map** to add email addresses that you use for committing code that may be different from the email address you used to sign up for CodeStream. For example, your CodeStream email address might be dave@acme.com, but you might also commit code as `dave@webmail.com`. 

Click **Add mapping**, enter your Git email address, and then select your entry from the list of organization members. That way, when someone comments on code committed by dave@webmail.com, CodeStream will know to at-mention you (such as, `dave@acme.com`).

While non-admins can only create blame maps for themselves, admins can create blame maps for any member of the organization. This is useful for reassigning code ownership when people leave the organization.
