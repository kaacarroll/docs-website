When you want to get started on some new work, whether it’s a modest bug fix or a major new feature, there are a lot of steps and different services involved. Go to your issue tracking service, find all of the issues assigned to you, select one to work on, and update its status. Now head to your terminal, or GitHub, to create a feature branch. And lastly, update your status on Slack to let your teammates know what you’re working on. With New Relic CodeStream, you can do this all in one step, right from your IDE.

To get started, go to the **Issues** section in the CodeStream pane and connect to your team’s issue tracking service.

Once you’re connected, you’ll be able to see all of the issues assigned to you, filtered by project, board, list, and others, customized as you see fit. You can even connect to multiple services.

You can view any issue on the issue-tracking service you're using.

If your team uses a feature branch Git workflow, you can create a branch to do your work on. Use the dropdowns to either change the base branch or edit the name of the feature branch.

If you’re an admin, you can set up a branch naming template for your organization so that your feature branches are named consistently.

Depending on which issue-tracking service you use, you can also update the issue's status. For example, if you use Trello, you can move the selected card to another list (for example, **In Progress**).

If you need to work on something that doesn’t have an associated issue you can either click **Start ad-hoc Work** to get started without one or click **New issue** to create an issue on your issue tracking service right from CodeStream. You can even associate your issue with a specific block of code in your editor.
