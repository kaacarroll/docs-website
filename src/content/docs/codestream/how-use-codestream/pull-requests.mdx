title: Manage pull requests in CodeStream
metaDescription: "How to create and review pull requests with New Relic CodeStream."
---

For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use New Relic CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow inside your IDE.

## Pull request workflow [#workflow]

There are four elements of CodeStream's pull request workflow. The following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each element.

Feature|Supported Services
-------------|-------
Create a pull request|GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server
Create a pull request across forks|GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed
Review and edit a pull request|GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed
Display pull request comments as code annotations|GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

## Create a pull request [#create]

To open a pull request at any time, click the **+** button at the top of the CodeStream pane or the **+** button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (`ctlr+shift+/` `p`, `ctrl+/` `p` on a Mac, and `m` if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream  provides you with tree view, list view, and diff view options for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request.

With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request, you can review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form.

To create a pull request across forks, click the **compare across forks** link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories.

You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top.

Before you can create a pull request, make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request.

When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connects the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request in the feedback request.

Add a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request.

## Review a pull request [#review]

<Callout variant="caution">
The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket.

Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it from within CodeStream. CodeStream brings GitHub and GitLab into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well.

You can edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels.

For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar.

By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the **Merge Requests** section of the CodeStream pane to enable this.

Review the conversation and add comments with the ability to @mention your collaborators.

View the changes, add comments, and submit a review.

CodeStream does improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of diff hunks. CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file you can use either list view or tree view. Select the code you want to comment on and then click the **Comment** button (or select **Comment** from the context menu).

![Add Comment](/images/PRComment-GH.png)

When commenting, you can either add a single comment or start a review.

![Start a Review](/images/PRCommentForm-GH.png)

With CodeStream, you can comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select any lines of code in the diff and not just those that are part of the changeset. These comments are added as a single comment to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress.

All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE.

## Leverage pull request comments [#pr-comments]

Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged, that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there's often useful information in those comments that may have long-term value, they're rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. 

![Pull Request Comment](/images/PRComment-Gutter1.png)

To have pull request comments displayed as annotations in your codemarks, as well as in the **Codemarks** section of the CodeStream pane, click the gear icon in that section and check **Show comments from pull requests**. When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service, you’ll be prompted to do so.

![Show Pull Request Comments](/images/CodemarksSection-Settings.png)

Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you've checked out either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch.

As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to.

PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.
